# Intro to python basics.

This part of the course is based on software carpentry's "Plotting and Programming in Python" course, with additional exercises and materials.

In this folder you will find all the material used to run the course.

* Links to the presentation material at software carpentry.
* The jupyter-notebook based exercises we will complete as part of the course.
* Solutions to the jupyter-notebook based exercises.
